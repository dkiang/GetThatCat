You sigh and hang up the phone. This morning you had been looking forward to kicking back with a cold lemonade and a game of Super Mario 64. Now the vet has reminded you that your cat has a routine checkup in half an hour. Normally affable and outgoing, your large furry tabby cat understands English and the minute he heard the word &quot;vet&quot; he made himself scarce. Now you have to chase him through the house and capture him. You aren&apos;t looking forward to the struggle.

Get That Cat!
Steel Cage Match by Douglas Kiang The release number is 1
Release 1 / Serial number 130228 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Living Room
This room is largeish, with a bank of sunny windows next to the door to the patio facing the street outside. There are lots of places a cat could hide, especially a cat who does not want to go to the vet. The hallway is to the south, and the kitchen is to the east.

You can see a pappasan, Sam, and a newspaper here.

Living Room

You can see a pappasan here.

You can see a cat carrier (empty) here.
